# COVID-19 COPASI Implementation
## Machine Learning in Computational Biology - Assignment 3

### Information
A prior implementation of a COIVD-10 SEIRD model using the [COPASI Tool](http://copasi.org/Research/).

### Installation
Download the *.cps file and open it using the COPASI UI.

### Execution
In plots section you can check the plots generated only for Greece.

### Comments
As the implementation is in a very initial stage, only the SEIRD model of Greece has been described using the tool. 
Italy's compartments and parameters should also be included and take part into its expression equations.
