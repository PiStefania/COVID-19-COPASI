# COVID-19 COPASI Implementation
## Machine Learning in Computational Biology - Assignment 3

### Information
A prior implementation of a COVID-10 SEIRD model FOR Greece and Italy, using the [COPASI Tool](http://copasi.org/Research/).
Linked research study can be found in the attached report.

### Installation
Download the *.cps* file and open it using the COPASI UI.

### Execution
In plots section you can check the plots generated for Greece and Italy, regarding the time course of COVID-19. \
Plots can be generated by running the `Time Course` Task in the Tasks section. In addition, reports are generated by running the \
`Steady-State`, `Sensitivities` and `Time Course Sensitivities`.

### Comments
As the implementation is in a initial stage, I tried to implement a SEIRD model both for Greece and Italy but the results are not the satisfactory ones.
